```

# Introduction

This is the analysis of the NNK3 peptides from the drift experiment. The required datasets are created in the "peptideAnalysis.R" file.


```{r create datasets}
setwd(dir = "C:/Users/worms/Dropbox/PhD/PhD-Scripts/CyclicPeptidePipeline")
source("peptideAnalysis.R")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
