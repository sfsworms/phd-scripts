# The goal of this script is to take the values outputted by the Baranyi-model earlier and see if they fit with the change in abundance observed both in NGS and in competition experiments

# Numerical Baranyi-Roberts model parameters

# # INPUT
# - A data frame containing the names of the peptides (peptide), their respective Âµmax (mumax) and their starting OD (y0)
# - A vector of time steps at which to compute the ODs
# - The constant across all strains: h0, K

# # OUTPUT
# A data frame containing the OD of each strain at each time point, according to the Baranyi-Roberts model (see Baranyi, 1994)

# Exemple Data
